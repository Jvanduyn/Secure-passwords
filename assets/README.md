# password-generator

## Description

During this project, I wanted to be able to put my Javascript skills to the test. This web app will allow users to generate a random password using the criteria that fits them. They will be walked through a series of promts that will intake the users criteria, and generate a password in less than a second. 

- My motivation for this project was to be able to put some of my Javascript skills into on larger scale project. This could allow other people to see the work I have been doing for themselves. 
- I built this project because I wanted to have anyone be able to use an easy to use project that I built. 
- This will solve any problem of any user to create a secure password.
- During this project I learned how to be able to impliment different practices into one large function and be able to pass that information and store it into an array.

## Credits

During this project, I collaborated with two people I would like to thank. 

First I collaborated with my fellow classmate Alexander. He and I were able to get most of the project working together minus a few bugs with the password length requirements.

Lastly I was able to work with a tutor of mine Vinnie Lopez. He was able to really help me polish the project off by getting the code working perfectly, and being able to consolidate most of the code to make it functioning properly.

## Features

This project allows a user to generate a password using the requirements the user selects and displays said password into the text box on the website. 

The user has the option to chose the following 
- Password character length
- If it uses uppercase letters
- If it uses lowercase letters
- If it has any numbers
- If there is any special characters.
